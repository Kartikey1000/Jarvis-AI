# Jarvis – A Personal Voice Assistant (Python)

Jarvis is a Python-based personal voice assistant that can recognize speech, process commands, and interact with your system in a smart way.  
It can perform everyday tasks like searching the web, opening applications, fetching news, playing music, and responding to voice commands — just like a real AI assistant.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis

👉 This way your GitHub repo will look **professional** and show others what your Jarvis can do.  

Do you want me to also **make a `requirements.txt`** template (with common libs like `speechrecognition`, `pyttsx3`, etc.) so people can run it easily?
